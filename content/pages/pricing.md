      - title: Why the money back guarentee?
        content: >
          We know our service is valuable. However, sometimes we can end up on a
          project together that isn't quite right. Our money back guarantee
          allows both parties to walk away as friends and come back together for
          another project with a better fit.
      - title: 'I have a website, what else can you do?'
        content: >
          If you already have your project up and running, we can offer two
          things\*\*. First, we can run a full health check of your website to
          make sure it meets modern website standards. Second, we offer digital
          advertising in the form of Google Pay Per Click and Facebook Ads.


          \*\* For the right project we also offer a bespoke sales service where
          we meet and close with your customers directly.
      - title: What kind of websites do you offer?
        content: >
          We focus on lead generation, so our favourite type of websites to
          build are service business website, brochure websites and lead
          generation websites.


          If you require something more technical, or are looking for e-commerce
          set up, our partner agencies would love to talk to you.


          Book a consultation with us and we can point you in the right
          direction.
      - title: Do you do advertising?
        content: >
          Yes! We offer digital advertising services for Google Pay Per Click
          and Facebook Ads. 


          We can either set it up and you can manage it in-house, or we can
          manage the project from end-to-end,


          We also offer training if you want to manage in-house but currently do
          not have the capability.
      - title: Why is your health check so expensive?
        content: >
          A faulty website will hold your business back. Slow loading times or
          difficult navigation cause customers to leave the site without giving
          you their details. How much is it worth to your business to make sure
          that customers love using your website?


          Compared to the results we see after fixing websites, our health check
          is cheap.
